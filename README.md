**Vulnerability Management & Automation**

This project demonstrates my work on automating vulnerability management using Python and IBM BigFix. It highlights how automation reduced manual efforts and improved the overall security posture by cutting the vulnerability backlog by 50%.

**Project Goals**
- Implement automated vulnerability scanning and reporting to reduce manual workload.
- Integrate IBM BigFix with Python for streamlined vulnerability tracking.
- Reduce vulnerability backlog by 50% and enhance the visibility of high-risk vulnerabilities.
- Save over 40 hours of manual work per week through automation.

**Key Achievements**
- **50% Reduction** in the vulnerability backlog through automation.
- **Improved Visibility** into critical vulnerabilities using IBM BigFix.
- **Time Savings**: Automation of tasks saved 40+ hours per week.

**Technologies Used**
- **IBM BigFix**: For vulnerability management and endpoint security.
- **Python**: For automating vulnerability retrieval and reporting.
- **SQL**: For extracting and analyzing vulnerability data.
- **GitHub Pages**: To present project results and code.

**Visual Results**
The following chart demonstrates the reduction in vulnerabilities over time due to the automation of the vulnerability management process:

How to Use
To run this project:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/drwhatchamacallit/VM-and-Automation
3. Install any required dependencies (if applicable).
4. Run the Python script: `python vulnerability_script.py`
5. The script will automatically pull data from IBM BigFix and generate a CSV report of vulnerabilities.

Future Improvements
- Expand automation to include patching of identified vulnerabilities.
- Integrate machine learning to predict future vulnerabilities based on historical data.
